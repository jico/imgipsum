# imgipsum

Dynamic placeholder images in Node. Inspired by [Dummy
Image](http://dummyimage.com/), [Placehold.it](http://placehold.it/), and the
likes.

---

## Requirements

* Node.js >= 0.10.0
* [Express](http://expressjs.com/) >= 4.0
* [Cairo](http://cairographics.org/) (required by [node-canvas](https://github.com/Automattic/node-canvas))

## Installation

Download `imgipsum` and save it as a dependency.

```bash
$ npm install imgipsum --save
```

Use it as middleware in your Express app.

```javascript
var express = require('express');
var app     = express();

var imgipsum = require('imgipsum');

app.use(imgipsum());

app.listen(8080);
console.log('Listening on ' + 8080);
```

### Settings

You can enable the middleware passing in optional parameters. The defaults are
listed below.

```javascript
app.use(imgipsum({
  colorBg:     '999',      // Default image background color
  colorFg:     'fff',      // Default image text color
  maxFontSize: 120,        // Max font size
  maxHeight:   1600,       // Max image height
  maxWidth:    1600,       // Max image width
  route:       'imgipsum', // Route endpoint to  respond to
  textPadding: 0.1         // Text padding (left/right) in percentage
}));
```

## Usage

The imgipsum middleware responds to requests at the route `/imgipsum`. The route
parameters, detailed through examples below, are similar to the [Dummy
Image](http://dummyimage.com/) and [Placehold.it](http://placehold.it/)
services.

The only required parameter is the image dimensions. All parameters following that are optional.
